# TTI

This project involves designing and assembling a detailed model of a Taran Tactical Innovations (TTI) pistol using SOLIDWORKS. The assembly includes all major components, such as the frame, slide, barrel, grip, trigger assembly, sights, and magazine, with attention to accuracy and functionality.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to create a highly detailed and accurate 3D model of a TTI pistol using SOLIDWORKS. This model can be used for educational purposes, simulations, and further design enhancements. The assembly ensures that all parts fit together seamlessly and mimic the actual firearmâ€™s operation.

Features
Detailed Components: Each part of the pistol, from the frame to the sights, is modeled with precision.
Realistic Textures and Materials: Appropriate materials and textures are applied to enhance the realism.
Functional Assembly: The assembly allows for movement simulation, such as the slide action and trigger pull.
Technical Drawings: Includes technical drawings for manufacturing and educational purposes.
Simulation Ready: Ready for static and dynamic analysis to test functionality and durability.
Components
1-Frame: The main body of the pistol.
2-Slide: The upper part that houses the barrel and sights.
3-Barrel: The part through which the bullet travels.
4-Grip: The handle of the pistol.
5-Trigger Assembly: Includes the trigger and associated parts.
6-Sights: Front and rear aiming devices.
7-Magazine: Holds the ammunition.
